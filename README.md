# Sprint
A compilation of some of the best configuration settings for getting a Mac up and running quickly.

This script is dependent upon having [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) set up before starting.

###*Use at your own risk*
While I've run this a few times myself to work the kinks out, you should take a look through before running it. There are some pretty heavily opinionated options (I couldn't find a suitable hot corners setup), so definitely take the time.

### Standing on the shoulders of giants
Perhaps one line of this was actually written by me. I'd like to give credit to the sources and original files I compiled this from.


- [Joe Tannenbaum](https://github.com/joetannenbaum) for the base script and the idea.
- [Lapwing Labs](http://lapwinglabs.com/blog/hacker-guide-to-setting-up-your-mac) for the "Hacker's Guide to Setting up Your Mac" which was integral.
- [OS X for Hackers/Brandon Brown](https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465) where most of the code is actually from.
